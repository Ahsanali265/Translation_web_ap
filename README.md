Healthcare Translation App for real-time voice-to-text and translation app

## Overview

This is a prototype web application designed for real-time transcription and translation, specifically tailored for healthcare settings. The application leverages the Web Speech API for speech recognition and text-to-speech functionalities, and the OpenAI API for translation.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file containing the structure and layout of the application.
- **style.css**: Inline CSS within the HTML file for basic styling.
- **script.js**: JavaScript code embedded within the HTML file to handle speech recognition, translation, and text-to-speech functionalities.

## Features

- **Real-Time Transcription**: Uses the Web Speech API to transcribe spoken language in real-time.
- **Translation**: Translates the transcribed text into a selected language using the OpenAI API.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Reads out the translated text using the Web Speech API.

## Usage

- **Start Listening**: Click the "Start Listening" button to begin speech recognition.
- **Stop Listening**: Click the "Stop Listening" button to stop speech recognition.
- **Speak Translated Text**: Click the "Speak Translated Text" button to read out the translated text.

## API Key

The application requires an OpenAI API key to function. Ensure you have your API key and replace the placeholder in the script with your actual key.

## Browser Compatibility

The application uses the Web Speech API, which may not be supported in all browsers. For the best experience, use the latest version of Chrome.
